WP AI Bridge connects a WordPress site to ChatGPT through a direct HTTPS MCP endpoint, WordPress-backed OAuth, the official WordPress MCP Adapter, and the WordPress Abilities API.

It exposes bounded, typed site-management abilities while keeping WordPress capabilities and explicit Bridge access groups in control.

## What it provides

- Direct ChatGPT Workspace App connection over HTTPS with OAuth 2.1 and PKCE.
- Read and update posts, pages, supported custom post types, revisions, and Gutenberg blocks.
- Admin-controlled generic post/term metadata access for exact WordPress objects the connected user may edit, including protected/private metadata without provider/post-type/taxonomy/meta-key allowlists.
- Media Library read, upload, safe URL import, update, and delete operations.
- Taxonomy and classic navigation management.
- Bounded WordPress site settings.
- WordPress.org plugin/theme lifecycle operations.
- Separately enabled installed plugin/theme source read, preview, apply, and conflict-safe recovery using native WordPress authority.
- User and role administration behind an explicit destructive-access group.
- Persistent Workspace documents and tasks for durable project context.
- Native Astra Ability reuse when Astra Abilities are enabled.
- Managed Code Snippets lifecycle support for compatible Code Snippets versions.
- Gravity Forms fallback through GFAPI when no native Gravity Forms Ability surface is active.
- Persian (`fa_IR`) localization and RTL-compatible admin screens.

## Requirements

- WordPress **6.9 or newer**.
- The official [WordPress MCP Adapter](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter), currently validated with `0.6.1`.
- HTTPS and a publicly reachable WordPress REST API for direct ChatGPT Workspace App connections.
- A WordPress account with the capabilities required for the operations you enable.

## Install

1. Download `wp-ai-bridge.zip` from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ach1992/wp-ai-bridge/releases/latest).
2. In WordPress open **Plugins → Add Plugin → Upload Plugin**.
3. Upload the ZIP, install it, and activate **WP AI Bridge**.
4. Install and activate the official WordPress MCP Adapter if it is not already active.
5. Open **WP AI Bridge → Settings**.

Existing installations upgrade in place: the public product/artifact name changed, but the installed plugin directory and persisted storage identifiers remain compatible so the rename does not create a second plugin or data store.

See [Installation and connection](./docs/INSTALLATION.md) for the complete setup.

## Connect ChatGPT

On an HTTPS WordPress site, **WP AI Bridge → Settings** shows the canonical MCP endpoint for the site:

```text
https://YOUR-SITE.example/wp-json/wp-ai-bridge/v1/mcp
```

In a ChatGPT workspace with Developer Mode enabled:

1. Open **Workspace settings → Apps**.
2. Create a custom App.
3. Enter the MCP endpoint shown by WordPress.
4. Choose OAuth authentication and run **Scan Tools**.
5. Sign in to WordPress when prompted.
6. Review the WordPress consent page and authorize ChatGPT.

Connections created with the former `wp-native-builder` MCP/OAuth routes remain supported as migration aliases. New connections and all UI/documentation use the WP AI Bridge routes.

No tunnel or separate proxy service is required for the direct HTTPS setup.

## WordPress admin

The plugin adds a top-level **WP AI Bridge** menu:

- **Dashboard** — Workspace summary and connection status.
- **Documents** — durable project documents.
- **Tasks** — durable work items with independent progress, review, and delivery state.
- **Activity** — bounded mutation activity.
- **Settings** — ChatGPT connection details and Bridge access groups.

Existing bookmarks that use the former `wp-native-builder...` admin slugs are retained as compatibility aliases; new navigation uses `wp-ai-bridge...` slugs.

Workspace state is private to WordPress and is not exposed through ordinary post, Gutenberg, or generic metadata abilities.

## Access groups

Bridge permissions are additive to normal WordPress capabilities. Enabling a Bridge group never grants a WordPress capability the connected user does not already have. Advanced Metadata is a deliberate exception to WordPress's generic protected-unregistered-meta default denial: when an administrator enables the group, protected unregistered post/term/user/comment metadata may be accessed through the exact target's native edit authority. Explicit registered/provider metadata authorization contracts remain authoritative.

| Group | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Site Read** | Inspect site information, content, media, navigation, extensions, integrations, and Workspace state. |
| **Builder Write** | Create and update drafts, content, Gutenberg blocks, media, taxonomies, navigation, forms, and Workspace objects. |
| **Remote Media** | Import safe HTTP(S) media into the Media Library; Builder Write and native upload authority are also required. |
| **Live Content** | Permit publishing and other live-content status changes when WordPress also permits them. |
| **Site Configuration** | Permit bounded global WordPress/theme configuration changes. |
| **Advanced Metadata** | Permit generic bounded metadata read/update for exact authorized post, term, user, and comment targets; role/capability/session/application-password/credential-like state, options, and Workspace internals remain excluded. |
| **Authentication & Credentials** | Permit Core-native WordPress Application Password list/get/create/rename/revoke operations. Disabled by default including upgrades; generated plaintext credentials are returned only once on successful create and are never persisted by the Bridge. |
| **Code & Extensions** | Permit supported managed-snippet and plugin/theme lifecycle operations. |
| **Source Editing** | Separately permit installed plugin/theme source read/preview/apply/recovery. Code & Extensions and native WordPress source-edit authority are still required. Disabled by default, including upgrades. |
| **Native Abilities** | Permit registered Core/provider Abilities to execute through the WP AI Bridge MCP routes when their own WordPress/provider permission checks also allow it. This is broad registered-operation trust, not a sandbox, and is disabled by default including upgrades. |
| **Comments** | Permit bounded standard-comment discovery, replies, and moderation through the fixed WordPress Core comments REST contract. Disabled by default including upgrades; permanent comment deletion additionally requires Users & Destructive. |
| **Users & Destructive** | Permit user/role administration and destructive operations when WordPress also permits them. Metadata deletion requires this group in addition to Advanced Metadata. |

Only **Site Read** is enabled by default.

## Uploads and extension installation

`wp-native-builder/media-upload` accepts file bytes plus a filename and hands them to WordPress Media Library handling. The maximum payload is the smaller of the WordPress upload limit and **20 MiB**. The caller cannot choose a server filesystem path.

`wp-native-builder/media-import-url` accepts a public HTTP(S) URL and a filename, streams it within the current WordPress upload limit, and creates a normal attachment. It requires explicit **Remote Media** plus **Builder Write** access; upgrades do not enable it automatically. See [URL media import](./docs/ABILITIES.md#url-media-import).

Plugin/theme installation is deliberately narrower: it accepts WordPress.org slugs through WordPress administration APIs. Source Editing is a separate administrator-level trust boundary and is not enabled by Code & Extensions alone. The Bridge does **not** expose arbitrary package URLs, shell commands, generic SQL, unrestricted filesystem access, arbitrary WordPress options, or generic credential retrieval. WordPress Application Passwords are available only through the separate default-off purpose-specific lifecycle described above.

## Compatibility identifiers

The public product is WP AI Bridge, but several established machine identifiers intentionally remain `wp-native-builder...` to preserve existing sites and clients. This includes the `wp-native-builder/*` Ability names, plugin installation directory/entrypoint, text domain, PHP namespace/constants, and persisted storage keys. These are compatibility contracts, not the current public brand.

## Optional integrations

Integration is discovery-first: provider-owned public WordPress Abilities are reused at runtime, so a compatible new plugin or theme should normally require no Bridge-specific code. Remote execution of those registered provider/Core Abilities through the Bridge requires explicit **Native Abilities** access in addition to the provider's own permission callback. Provider fallbacks are reserved for bounded gaps with documented public APIs. Generic post, term, user, and comment metadata is provider-neutral and does not require a new Bridge adapter merely because a plugin/theme stores state in `post_meta` or `term_meta`. See [Architecture](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#discovery-and-reuse).

- **Astra / Astra Pro:** enable Astra's **Abilities** setting. A separate Astra MCP server is not required for this Bridge setup.
- **Code Snippets:** compatible provider APIs are used for managed snippet lifecycle; the Bridge does not directly evaluate submitted code.
- **Gravity Forms:** native provider Abilities are preferred; otherwise the bounded GFAPI fallback is used when available.
- **WooCommerce:** verified provider Abilities may be reused. Broad commerce/customer/order fallbacks are not exposed automatically.

See [Integrations](./docs/INTEGRATIONS.md) for details.

## Security model

WP AI Bridge is intentionally not a general remote-administration shell. It combines:

- WordPress OAuth identity;
- WordPress capabilities and object-level checks;
- explicit Bridge access groups;
- closed input/output schemas;
- stale-write/concurrency protection for overwrite-sensitive operations;
- bounded mutation logging;
- provider-native permission checks where integrations are used.

Read [Security](./docs/SECURITY.md) before enabling write, Advanced Metadata, Authentication & Credentials, Source Editing, Native Abilities, or destructive access on an important site.
