# Security model

WP AI Bridge is designed as a bounded WordPress capability layer, not a general remote shell.

## Layered authorization

Bridge-owned operations must satisfy every applicable layer:

1. valid OAuth-authenticated WordPress identity for direct ChatGPT connections;
2. the relevant Bridge access group;
3. the required WordPress capability or object-level/meta authorization rule;
4. any provider-native permission check used by an integration;
5. operation-specific live-state, destructive, and stale-state rules.

OAuth never enables a Bridge access group and never grants a WordPress capability. Registered non-Bridge Core/provider Abilities executed through the WP AI Bridge MCP routes additionally require the default-off **Native Abilities** group; the target's own WordPress/provider permission callback remains independently authoritative. Bridge-owned operations keep their documented ability-specific groups.

## Repository review and live-system boundary

Security-sensitive development and review of this repository are source-first and non-production by default. Follow the [repository-scoped evidence ladder and defensive task/review envelope](./DEVELOPMENT.md#repository-scoped-ai-development-and-security-review) before considering live-system activity.

Routine implementation and HIGH_ASSURANCE source review do not require a production WordPress site, real user credentials, real Application Passwords, OAuth/private-key material, bearer/session tokens, unrelated third-party targets, or production mutation. Use synthetic fixtures and isolated WordPress containers for adversarial ordering, concurrency, reentrancy, authorization, and provenance cases whenever feasible.

Prompts, Issues, pull requests, review packets, logs, fixtures, and CI artifacts must not request or contain raw secrets or unnecessary personal data. If an explicitly authorized environment legitimately requires credentialed access, use the approved runtime/connector mechanism without surfacing the secret value to the model or repository artifacts.

Source-code review is not operational penetration testing. Any future live penetration test, production attack simulation, privileged credential operation, or third-party interaction must be a separate explicitly authorized work item identifying the exact target, environment, purpose, allowed effects, and applicable approval boundary. Repository access, CI access, or HIGH_ASSURANCE status does not imply that authorization.

If a provider or tool restricts one review route, continue safe repository-scoped analysis and use equivalent authoritative evidence where available. Report any remaining evidence limitation instead of bypassing a platform safety/identity check, fabricating proof, or weakening a security invariant. A restriction that genuinely prevents required evidence makes the review incomplete; it does not turn missing evidence into approval.

Independent review and green CI remain evidence, not authorization. HIGH-risk integration, production deployment, live permission enablement, production credential lifecycle operations, and destructive or irreversible actions retain their separate current gates.

## Access groups

- **Site Read** — read-only inspection surfaces.
- **Builder Write** — bounded content/site-building mutations.
- **Remote Media** - default-off outbound media import; Builder Write and native upload/parent authority remain required.
- **Live Content** — publishing and other live-state transitions.
- **Site Configuration** — bounded global configuration.
- **Advanced Metadata** — protected/private post, term, user, and comment metadata for exact WordPress objects the connected user may edit; disabled by default and intentionally separate from ordinary Site Read/Builder Write access. Authentication/authorization/session/credential state remains excluded from the generic user-meta surface.
- **Authentication & Credentials** — default-off purpose-specific WordPress Application Password lifecycle through fixed Core REST routes. The generated plaintext credential is returned only once on successful create; stored hashes and reusable credentials are never exposed later.
- **Code & Extensions** — managed snippets and extension lifecycle.
- **Source Editing** — separately enabled installed plugin/theme source read/preview/apply/recovery; executable PHP is administrator-level code trust, not a sandbox.
- **Native Abilities** — default-off broad trust for registered non-Bridge Core/provider Abilities reached through the WP AI Bridge MCP routes. It is not a sandbox; provider/Core permission checks remain mandatory.
- **Comments** — default-off bounded standard-comment discovery, replies, and moderation through fixed Core comment REST routes. Permanent deletion additionally requires Users & Destructive.
- **Users & Destructive** — user administration and destructive operations. Generic post/term/user/comment metadata deletion requires this group in addition to Advanced Metadata.

Only Site Read is enabled by default.

## Native Ability delegation boundary

Native Abilities is provider-neutral broad consent, not effect inference or a provider allowlist. It gates registered non-Bridge Ability execution only while the request is executing through the exact canonical or retained legacy Bridge MCP route. It does not affect direct `WP_Ability::execute()`, the Adapter default server, or WP-CLI.

A registered target must pass both enabled Native Abilities and its own native permission callback. The Bridge may add a denial but never converts a provider/Core denial into allow. Names, descriptions, categories, optimistic annotations, provider-supplied metadata, and custom Ability getters do not authorize execution. Bridge ownership is bound only to the exact successful Ability objects returned to Bridge provider code by its own Core `wp_register_ability()` calls and forwarded by `Registrar` to the injected delegation instance. Re-entrant provider registrations, filter ordering, later same-name replacements, the historical `wp-native-builder/*` namespace, `wp_ai_bridge_owned`, and overridden `get_meta()` cannot establish or inherit Bridge ownership. The private provenance set contains only object identity and is not a parallel Ability registry.

Disabling Native Abilities takes effect on subsequent Bridge calls because settings are read at execution time. The exact Bridge request context is balanced with unconditional cleanup; unrelated REST routes are not governed by that context.


## Application Password boundary

Authentication & Credentials is separate default-off consent for WordPress Application Password administration. Existing Site Read, Users & Destructive, Advanced Metadata, Native Abilities, or historical grants do not enable it on fresh installs or upgrades.

The Bridge exposes no generic authentication REST proxy. It constructs only the fixed Core `/wp/v2/users/<user>/application-passwords` collection/item routes and delegates availability, multisite target membership, and the exact `list_app_passwords`, `read_app_password`, `create_app_password`, `edit_app_password`, `delete_app_password`, and `delete_app_passwords` decisions to WordPress Core.

Core returns the plaintext Application Password only when it is created. The Bridge returns that value only in the successful create response and does not store it in Bridge settings, Workspace, mutation logs, errors, later list/get/update/revoke responses, or artifacts. Read/list normalization deliberately excludes Core's stored password/hash field and also omits last-IP data; only UUID, app ID, name, creation time and last-used time are retained as bounded management metadata. Exact/bulk revocation responses discard Core `previous` records rather than relaying secret-bearing internal state.

Create cleanup never trusts a filterable REST response UUID, link, `Location` header, caller value, name, app ID, list order, or public Application Password action as destructive authority. Before inspecting credential storage, Bridge first runs Core's exact target-specific create permission check; this prevents Core's legacy UUID-backfill behavior in the Application Password reader from mutating storage for an unauthorized caller. Only after authorization does Bridge snapshot the target. Create provenance is accepted only at the `_application_passwords` pre-write boundary when the observed call is the direct Core persistence chain `update_metadata()` → `update_user_meta()` → `WP_Application_Passwords::set_user_application_passwords()` → `create_new_application_password()` → the exact internal `WP_REST_Application_Passwords_Controller::create_item()` request. The nearest metadata write must be that direct Core chain, and the full call stack must contain exactly one matching `WP_REST_Application_Passwords_Controller::create_item()` invocation plus exactly one `rest_do_request()` for the exact request object. A re-entrant/provider same-key `update_user_meta()` call or nested re-dispatch of that same `WP_REST_Request` therefore cannot inherit outer-create provenance. The genuine outer persistence attempt is allowed only when no earlier metadata callback has already short-circuited it and its proposed state is current state plus exactly one new credential with all prior credential fingerprints unchanged; otherwise Bridge blocks that outer write and requires recovery. Only the exact proposed UUID, stored-hash fingerprint and full-item fingerprint are retained in memory. The later exact-request `rest_after_insert_application_password` event is only a success cross-check for the same UUID and Core-formatted one-time password.

For cleanup, Bridge keeps the fixed Core REST DELETE lifecycle but does not rely on an earlier fingerprint snapshot as the decisive destructive check. A request-scoped `_application_passwords` pre-write guard runs at the actual Core delete persistence boundary and accepts only the direct chain ending in `delete_application_password()` → the exact internal `delete_item()` request. At that point the current record must still have the captured hash/full-item fingerprint, and the proposed write must equal current state minus exactly that record while every unrelated credential remains fingerprint-identical. If installed code changes or replaces the record with the same UUID anywhere between the earlier check and Core persistence, the delete write is blocked and Bridge returns `application_password_create_recovery_required`; a reused UUID cannot inherit cleanup authority. Successful create still requires final stored state to equal the baseline plus exactly the captured credential. These controls provide bounded optimistic integrity around the exact Core persistence attempts, not serializable isolation; nested, re-entrant, provider-altered or otherwise unprovable state fails closed rather than authorizing a guessed cleanup target. UUIDs, stored hashes, fingerprints and plaintext credentials are not emitted through Bridge logs/errors by this protocol.

This group does not manage account passwords, password-reset keys, sessions, cookies, nonces, WP AI Bridge OAuth credentials, or generic user authentication metadata. `_application_passwords` remains blocked from generic user metadata. Revoke-all is a separate operation and requires the explicit `revoke_all` confirmation token.

## Comments administration boundary

Comments access is independent from Site Read and Builder Write and defaults off on fresh installs and upgrades. The Bridge does not expose a generic REST dispatcher: comment operations construct only fixed `/wp/v2/comments` collection or numeric item routes, then let WordPress Core validate/sanitize inputs and enforce its own comment/post permissions. Public list pagination is additionally confined to one exact Core-readable post; positive parent filters are accepted only when the parent itself is a readable approved standard comment on that same post, preventing Core's pre-filter collection totals from becoming an aggregate side channel across unreadable content.

Bridge output deliberately excludes comment author email/IP, user-agent, arbitrary comment metadata, and other hidden REST fields. Returned comment content is UTF-8-safe byte-bounded and reports `content_truncated` explicitly. Reply input cannot supply those fields either. Mutation methods also reject non-standard comment types before status/delete operations.

Permanent comment deletion is compositionally gated. `force=true` requires **Comments + Users & Destructive + exact WordPress target permission**. Non-force deletion never calls the Core DELETE route: it uses the Core status-update lifecycle to move a comment to Trash, and if it is already trashed Bridge returns the existing state without mutation. Only explicit force-delete reaches Core DELETE, eliminating both second-delete and check-then-delete race paths to unintended permanent deletion. Permission is re-read again at execution time so revocation between permission inspection and execution fails closed.

## Advanced post metadata boundary

Advanced Metadata exists for legitimate theme/plugin/builder state that is stored in `post_meta` instead of `post_content`. It is provider- and post-type-neutral and does not require a new hardcoded allowlist entry for every theme, plugin, CPT, or meta key.

The boundary is deliberately layered:

- the Advanced Metadata group must be enabled by a WordPress administrator;
- the target must be a real WordPress post object and the connected WordPress user must be able to edit that exact object;
- revision IDs are canonicalized to the parent before metadata authorization, physical-state inspection, hashing, or mutation, matching the target used by WordPress post-meta mutation wrappers;
- the target post type does not need to be public, REST-exposed, or editor-capable;
- Bridge-private Workspace post types (`wpnb_doc` and `wpnb_task`) are explicitly excluded;
- normal post-meta capabilities remain authoritative for public keys and for keys where Core/provider code registered metadata or installed an explicit authorization filter;
- protected/private unregistered keys may use the target post's `edit_post` authority once Advanced Metadata is enabled, because WordPress otherwise denies such keys generically merely for being protected;
- additional capability requirements and `do_not_allow` returned by the final `map_meta_cap` pipeline remain authoritative;
- credential-like key names are excluded through a provider-neutral normalization rule that covers common separator, camelCase, compact, singular, and plural password/secret/credential, API/private-key, OAuth/access/refresh, session, identity/ID, JWT, bearer/auth, and related security-token forms without banning unrelated uses of the generic word `token`;
- list operations return keys/state summaries only; exact values require an explicitly named key;
- mutation identity comes from the physical `wp_postmeta` rows, including physical row IDs and raw stored values, rather than registered defaults or `get_post_metadata` virtual-read short circuits;
- SQL `NULL` is preserved as a distinct physical raw state and cannot alias the empty string in `state_hash`;
- updates/deletes require an exact `state_hash` and refuse ambiguous multi-row keys;
- existing-row update/delete uses a narrowly bounded internal compare-and-swap against the inspected `meta_id + post_id + meta_key + raw meta_value`; key/value predicates are byte-exact rather than text-collation equality, and SQL `NULL` uses an explicit `IS NULL` branch;
- after an exact mutation, verification remains inside the persistence boundary. If interference is detected, update rolls back only its own unchanged written row and delete restores only its own exact deleted row before returning a stale conflict;
- compensation emits the corresponding WordPress metadata lifecycle actions for the restored final physical state. Integrity compensation is not vetoable by metadata short-circuit filters after the Bridge has already committed the first exact mutation;
- absent-row creation still uses WordPress `add_post_meta(..., true)` for normal Core unslashing, one-pass sanitization, and hooks. The Bridge observes the already-sanitized value without invoking the sanitizer a second time, then treats the returned meta ID as its own only while that exact post/key/raw identity is unchanged;
- because Core uniqueness is a SELECT-then-INSERT check rather than a database unique constraint, a create race can still yield multiple rows. In that case the Bridge byte-exactly removes only its own still-unchanged row and emits the corresponding delete lifecycle. If an observer changed the returned row first, the Bridge leaves it untouched and reports stale instead of claiming ownership;
- metadata values containing PHP objects/resources at any depth, or values that do not survive the generic JSON contract structurally unchanged, are not generically replaceable or deletable;
- delete additionally requires Users & Destructive access.

The exact-row compare-and-swap helper is an internal fixed-purpose implementation detail, not an API surface. It accepts no SQL, table name, column name, meta ID, query fragment, or database selector from the MCP client; it is hard-bound to the already-authorized `wp_postmeta` row. The only raw SQL is the fixed prepared byte-exact update/delete predicate required to avoid database-collation equivalence. Static safety checks confine these two logical exact-row operations to six fixed prepared SQL branches in the post-meta store and keep direct database use forbidden elsewhere in production source except the separately confined term-meta store described below. The Bridge still exposes no arbitrary SQL or general database administration.

This mechanism provides a bounded row-level stale-write/compensation protocol, not a database transaction or serializable isolation guarantee. A write that occurs after the Bridge's verified linearization point is simply a newer state and can make the returned `state_hash` stale immediately, as with any optimistic-concurrency token.

## Advanced term metadata boundary

Issue #36 extends the same default-off group to term metadata, without changing the post-meta persistence or authorization implementation. The secret-key normalization is shared verbatim with post metadata rather than duplicated.

Term identity is **both `term_id` and `taxonomy`**: the taxonomy must be registered, explicit and canonical term resolution must agree, Core's term metadata subtype must agree, and shared legacy term IDs fail closed. WordPress `edit_term` and operation-specific `add_term_meta`, `edit_term_meta`, or `delete_term_meta` mapping determine authority; no global `manage_categories` or `manage_options` substitutes for it. Protected unregistered metadata may override only Core's default protected-key denial under explicit administrator opt-in. The narrowly scoped temporary authorization callback preserves subsequent provider/mapped denials, additional primitive requirements, `do_not_allow`, and original `user_has_cap` object/key context. Registered/global/subtype metadata authorization and explicit authorization filters, including priority zero, are never replaced. Delete additionally requires Users & Destructive.

The term store is separate because term identity, subtype resolution, shared-term behavior and lifecycle differ from posts. It writes only `$wpdb->termmeta`. The fixed inventory contains two bounded reads, one Core-equivalent uniqueness count, four update and two delete CAS branches, and two conditional insert branches shared by creation/restoration. Every write joins the original native `terms`/`term_taxonomy` identity; those tables are never mutated by the store. Complete literal prepared templates and their exact table/identity/value arguments are independently checked by the token-based confinement script. No client-selected table, SQL/query fragment, physical row ID or schema selector is accepted. Broad lists never load values. Named reads remain limited to two rows and 1 MiB per value; SQL errors are not absence. All prior post-meta restrictions remain unchanged.

Term state identity includes physical row ID and typed raw bytes, preserving SQL `NULL` versus empty string and distinguishing absent rows from registered defaults. Stored serialization is preflighted as a complete scalar/array-only stream before native decoding, preventing object/enum autoloading. Decoding additionally disables classes and bounds depth; objects/resources, malformed/non-canonical serialization and structures that cannot round-trip through JSON are not generically exposed as values, replaced, or deleted. Sanitized output is checked before serialization/persistence. Core sanitization runs once, not twice.

Existing-row update/delete checks authority after the pre-mutation lifecycle hook and binds both byte-exact metadata state and the original real term/taxonomy/term-taxonomy identity in the physical DML statement. Primary writes do not rely on a post-insert recheck to avoid wrong-target changes. Conditional inserts include an explicit locking source read, rather than an unprotected snapshot-only identity lookup. No explicit transaction, session-isolation change, query rewrite, or global database interception is used.

Creation reproduces the native one-pass sanitization, completed provider short-circuit pipeline, normal-collation unique precheck, and add/added lifecycle around the conditional insert, since `add_term_meta()` cannot put that identity condition in its own insert. Non-null provider short circuits remain unsupported, not evidence of row ownership. The statement's new ID is captured before added observers execute. The native 255-character key storage bound is checked before direct persistence; the 1 MiB safe-value bound remains unchanged. Core's SELECT-then-INSERT uniqueness behavior remains optimistic rather than a new database uniqueness guarantee.

Create contention cleans only the unchanged Bridge-owned row. Update compensation restores only bytes the invocation still owns; delete compensation inserts only its original positive physical ID, refusing collisions rather than overwriting another owner. All three compensation operations preserve original target checks before/after their pre-hooks and bind the same identity again inside their physical SQL. Only create cleanup has an internal alternative to delete its unchanged orphan when both native term and taxonomy records are absent. A transferred or shared live target never qualifies. Actual compensation emits the matching lifecycle events and cache invalidation. It is not an unrestricted rollback of concurrent writes or provider effects.

The protocol provides bounded optimistic integrity, not serializable isolation. Trusted installed WordPress code can independently change state; newer writes after verification can stale a response immediately. A compensation failure is a diagnostic boundary requiring fresh inspection, not permission to overwrite newer state. The mutation log contains only ability/target type/target ID/status/error code, never term-meta keys, values, full payloads or credentials.

User/comment metadata has its own object-authority, multisite, credential-exclusion and fixed-purpose persistence rules; see [User and comment metadata](./USER-COMMENT-METADATA.md).

## Stale-write protection

Overwrite-sensitive content, post/term/user/comment metadata, and Workspace operations return change identities. A later update must present the expected current identity. If the object changed after inspection, the Bridge rejects the write and requires the caller to refresh.

Post metadata uses deterministic physical-row identity plus byte-exact row compare-and-swap. Verification is performed within the bounded persistence operation. Concurrent duplicate/add/update/delete interference detected before that verification completes is reported as stale; where the Bridge already changed one row, it performs row-scoped compensation and corresponding lifecycle actions rather than overwriting/deleting concurrent state. If the exact compensation predicate no longer matches, the operation returns a dedicated compensation failure instead of overwriting newer bytes or claiming success.

Workspace documents/tasks use monotonic `version` plus deterministic `state_hash` with an atomic compare-and-swap against the previous state payload.

## Content, Gutenberg, and metadata isolation

Generic content/Gutenberg operations remain limited to their existing eligible editor-capable content predicate. Advanced Metadata is intentionally broader because the site administrator explicitly opts into it, but Bridge-private Workspace storage remains excluded from the generic metadata surface and is reachable only through the dedicated Workspace contract.

## Upload boundary

Media upload accepts bytes and a filename, writes only to a WordPress-generated temporary path, and hands the result to WordPress media/sideload handling. The caller cannot specify a server filesystem path.

The payload cap is the smaller of the WordPress upload limit and 20 MiB.

## Remote media boundary

URL import is separately default-off, including upgrades where Builder Write was already enabled. It uses native safe HTTP(S) URL/redirect validation and TLS verification without relaxing WordPress security filters. Requests stream to a WordPress-owned staging file with a finite timeout, redirect budget, and current upload-limit-plus-one byte cap. WordPress then owns MIME/sideload/attachment handling. Neither arbitrary request headers/cookies nor caller-chosen server paths are accepted.

Authority is rechecked before network activity and before file/attachment mutation, including after temporary-file allocation. Permission-hook exceptions fail closed. Ordinary failures remove known staging files; a returned insertion error or revoked authority before insertion removes only the known newly uploaded destination. The importer rejects executable filenames and never performs package extraction/installation. Expected errors and unexpected import/cleanup exceptions are redacted rather than forwarding provider/HTTP messages containing signed URLs, response bodies or filesystem paths. Mutation logs contain only operation/attachment identity, success and a bounded error code.

Unexpected exceptions, failed cleanup, or failed final audit reporting produce `media_import_recovery_required`, not success. Known cleanup is verified without retrying failed deletion hooks. A native sideload or insert can mutate state before throwing and returning its path/ID; unknown or potentially committed state is retained for inspection, not deleted based on a missing return value. Already-returned attachment IDs remain available in recovery guidance. A fixed English fallback prevents a failing translation or audit hook from disclosing another exception; it does not guarantee audit persistence. This boundary covers the import callbacks and known cleanup, not arbitrary PHP output or hooks executed by Core/Adapter outside the import callback.

The import adds private/reserved-address checks to native URL validation: all returned IPv4 resolver addresses and available DNS A/AAAA records must pass PHP address validation (including the global-range flag where supported). The same check runs through the native Requests redirect hook, scoped to the invocation-owned stream filename and removed in `finally`; unrelated HTTP requests are not governed by this temporary callback. Core URL/TLS checks and finite redirect limits are not relaxed. The native fixture proves that reserved initial URLs fail before HTTP and reserved redirect targets are refused by the actual Core/Requests hook dispatcher without connecting to those targets. Resolver checks are not DNS pinning: transport re-resolution, a configured proxy, trusted PHP hooks and hosting egress policy remain separate environmental boundaries.


This contract does not make imports transactional or retries idempotent. A process crash or arbitrary provider hook can have effects beyond temporary-file cleanup. Core networking and installed filters remain authoritative; native safe HTTP is not a promise of isolation from malicious PHP or a replacement for deployment egress restrictions.

## Extension boundary

Plugin/theme installation accepts WordPress.org slugs resolved through WordPress Core APIs. Arbitrary package URLs, uploaded plugin ZIPs, PHP files, and caller-selected server paths are not accepted.

Deletion requires destructive access in addition to the action-specific WordPress capability. Active extensions are protected where deletion would be unsafe.


## Installed source editing

Source Editing is a separate default-off trust boundary. Enabling `Code & Extensions` does not grant it on either a fresh install or upgrade. Every operation rechecks both Bridge groups, WordPress file-modification policy, and the matching native `edit_plugins`/`edit_themes` capability. `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT`, `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS`, multisite/Super Admin rules, and target writeability therefore remain authoritative denials rather than settings the Bridge bypasses.

The caller never supplies an OS path. Installed plugin/theme identity and one relative file are resolved from Core editable inventories, then canonicalized. The final real path must stay inside the exact installed extension root; traversal, symlink escape, target switching, and arbitrary server/configuration paths fail closed. Production source mutation is a fixed-purpose same-filesystem replacement protocol, not a generic filesystem API: the complete replacement is staged under an unguessable recovery-token-keyed internal artifact name on the exact source filesystem, the live pathname is quarantined, the bytes actually moved are compared with the expected hash, and publication uses hard-link no-replace semantics. `WP_Filesystem_Direct` remains bounded to source reads. The Bridge does not expose filesystem credentials or caller-selected paths.

PHP candidates pass `TOKEN_PARSE` before any mutation. Preview binds the exact target, preimage SHA-256, candidate SHA-256, and candidate identity. Apply re-resolves the target after a cooperative lock, rechecks the preimage, persists one bounded private recovery record, then enters the guarded replacement boundary. If another writer changes the path before quarantine, the quarantined bytes fail the expected-hash check; if another writer recreates the path after quarantine, no-replace publication fails and those newer bytes win. The staged file must be able to preserve the quarantined file's mode/owner/group, and the exact source directory/filesystem must support the required hard-link primitive and fixed-purpose internal replacement artifacts; otherwise apply fails closed. Active PHP then performs Core-compatible scrape validation through ordinary WordPress boot without synthetic admin authentication. Network-active failures that occur before scraper registration are treated as validation failures rather than success.

Recovery uses the same guarded no-overwrite replacement primitive and can restore only when the bytes moved from the live pathname still equal the exact candidate owned by the pending record. A non-cooperating writer that wins the current pathname before or during recovery is preserved rather than overwritten. Shutdown recovery routes through the same guarded recovery path. Crash reconciliation never treats an absent live pathname as Bridge-owned merely because a known hold remains: that absence may be a legitimate post-publication delete/rename, so automatic recreation fails closed. Private stage/probe/hold removal is verified; cleanup failure retains the recovery record instead of producing terminal success. Pending recovery ownership is preserved across uninstall for later reinstall/reconciliation. Failed or unverifiable compensation retains the private record and reports recovery-required/uncertain state; it never claims a database/filesystem transaction or promises to undo arbitrary PHP side effects that already executed. Source/preimage payloads and full diffs are excluded from the ordinary mutation log.

The integrity guarantee is generation-aware: after the atomic no-replace publication boundary, an already-open descriptor to the previous inode is no longer a descriptor to the installed live pathname. Writes through that stale descriptor cannot alter the published source generation. Bridge detects and preserves changes to the quarantined generation that are observable before retirement, but it does not claim to preserve arbitrary future writes to a superseded inode after the current-path replacement has committed; portable PHP provides advisory `flock`, not revocation of non-participating open descriptors or an atomic content-compare-and-unlink operation. External writers must reopen the pathname after an atomic replacement before making a new installed-source edit.

This boundary grants code trust when explicitly enabled: PHP written into an installed extension runs with the authority available to that WordPress runtime. It is not isolation, evaluation sandboxing, OS-root access, or a generic PHP execution endpoint.

## Managed code snippets

Code Snippets integration is an intentional bounded provider integration. Submitted code is passed through the installed Code Snippets lifecycle API and its capability checks. The Bridge does not evaluate the code directly or provide a generic PHP execution endpoint.

## Explicitly absent generic surfaces

The Bridge does not expose:

- arbitrary SQL or database administration;
- shell/process execution;
- WP-CLI execution;
- unrestricted filesystem access;
- arbitrary `wp_options` access;
- arbitrary user-meta administration;
- credential, session, OAuth-secret, private-key, security-token, or Application Password retrieval;
- arbitrary plugin ZIP/PHP upload;
- direct provider-table administration.

## OAuth storage

Authorization codes, access tokens, and refresh tokens are opaque. Secret-bearing values are not intentionally stored in plaintext. Refresh tokens rotate, revocation is supported, and the direct MCP resource is bound to the OAuth flow.

## Activity logging

The mutation log is bounded and metadata-oriented. It should not be treated as a content archive and must not be used to log credentials, metadata keys, metadata values, or full submitted payloads.
